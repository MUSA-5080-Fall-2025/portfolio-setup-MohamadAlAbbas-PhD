## Ongoing Research Projects

- **Born in a Haze: Early-life exposure to forest fires and child health in Indonesia**  
  - Examines impacts of forest fire–related haze on children’s HAZ/WAZ growth indicators using IFLS data.  
  - Develops clustering algorithms and k-means quintile regression for fire exposure.  

- **Crude Consequences: The Impact of Oil Spills on Child Health and Environmental Vulnerability in Nigeria**  
  - Integrates MICS data with daily oil spill trackers.  
  - Explores stratified vulnerability and child health outcomes.  

- **Climate–Health across Biomes: Stratified impacts of precipitation and temperature on children’s health**  
  - Multi-country analysis of diarrhea, fever, cough, and WHZ outcomes.  
  - Examines biome interactions with climate anomalies.  

- **Cross-Border Nutritional Vulnerability in Shared Ecologies (India, Bangladesh, Nepal)**  
  - DHS-based spatial analysis of child undernutrition near borders.  
  - Tests whether ecological context outweighs political boundaries.  

- **CRAM (Climate-Resilient Access Metric): Healthcare isolation in vulnerable regions**  
  - Developing an index to measure resilience of healthcare access to climate shocks.  
  - Focus on flood seasonality and maternal health risks.  

- **Long-Term PM2.5 Exposure and Cardiovascular Disease in Indonesia**  
  - Cohort-based study using IFLS (2000–2014).  
  - Models morbidity-adjusted CVD outcomes under cumulative pollution exposure.  

- **Disaster–Health Mediation: Natural disasters as instruments for water contamination**  
  - Uses IV regression with MICS surveys to assess diarrheal outcomes.  
  - Explores mediation via healthcare-seeking behaviors and infrastructure.

## In Progress Methodological Work

- **Multistate Life Table Models**  
  - Transition modeling between Healthy–Unhealthy–Dead states in IFLS morbidity data.  
  - Replication of Payne et al. (2013) with microsimulation extensions.  

- **Spatial Climate–Health Pipelines**  
  - Dynamic extraction of precipitation/temperature anomalies via CHIRPS/NOAA rasters.  
  - Integrating z-scores and climate windows aligned with DHS/MICS survey interviews.
