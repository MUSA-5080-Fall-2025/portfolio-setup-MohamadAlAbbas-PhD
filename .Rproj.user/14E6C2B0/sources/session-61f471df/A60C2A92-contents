## Key Concepts Learned
<!-- [Concepts & Not codes] -->
- Setting up repositories on

## Coding Techniques
- Basics of tidyverse and its accompanying commands of filter(), select(), mutate(), and summarize()
- Quarto functions on how to **bold**, *italics*, ***both bold and italics***, `code list`, and ~~strikethrough~~ 

## Questions & Challenges
<!-- [What I didn't fully understand]] -->
<!-- [Areas needing more practice] -->
- Everything was clear. I would still like to mess around more with Quarto.

## Connections to Policy
<!-- [How this week's content applies to real policy work] -->
- This was a building block week, so not much of direct application rather tracking and documentation baseline for setup. 

## Reflection
- Learning how to create a custom repository was both enjoyable and insightful.
- It could also serve as a way to share supplementary analyses and to present code in a more public, graphical, and accessible format for non-coding audiences.
