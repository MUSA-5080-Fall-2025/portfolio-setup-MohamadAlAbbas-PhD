## Key Concepts Learned
<!-- [Concepts & Not codes] -->

- Algorithms are a set of rules or instructions for solving a problem and completing a task.
- Algorithms in a government are typically systems used to assist or replace human decision-makers:  
  - Based on predictions from models trained on historical data.  
  - Using inputs (features or predictors) and outputs (outcome, dependent variable).  
- Long history of government data collection:  
  - Census data  
  - Civil registration system  
  - Administrative records  
- Budgetary constraints force governments to use algos:  
  - Efficiency: faster case processing  
  - Consistency: same rules applied to everyone  
  - Objectivity: removes human bias  
  - Cost savings  
- Issues with Algorithms:  
  - Data cleaning decisions (might not be good)  
  - Data coding or classification (misclassification, race for example)  
  - Data collection (proxies for items)  
  - How results are interpreted  
  - What variables you put in the model  
  - EX: Healthcare algo bias whereby black patients are discriminated against due to proxies for healthcare needs.  
- Census data is used for:  
  - Understanding community demos  
  - Allocate government resources  
  - Tracking neighborhood change  
  - Designing fair algos  
  - Put into the constitution by Madison  
- Censuses are decennial and contain 9 basic demographic questions.  
- ACS is 3% of households, done annually, and has more detailed questions on income, education, employment, and housing costs.  
- ACS is aggregated to 5-year estimates (to have more reliable data):  
  - County-level ACS data is for state and regional planning  
  - Census tract level  
  - Block group level: local analysis, but has large margins of errors (MOEs)  
- To protect privacy the census applies mathematical noise to individual data while preserving overall patterns:  
  - MOEs might skew results slightly or cause biases  
- TIGER is Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system.  

## Coding Techniques

- GEOID: geographic identifier  
- NAM: Human-readable location  
- Typical output is long, but you can force `output = "wide"`  
- `str_remove()`, `str_extract()`, `str_replace()`  
- `kable()` for professional formatting  

## Questions & Challenges
<!-- [What I didn't fully understand] -->
<!-- [Areas needing more practice] -->

- Make my interpretations understandable for a policy audience.  

## Connections to Policy
<!-- [How this week's content applies to real policy work] -->

- Algorithmic decision making → understanding why your analysis matters for real policy decisions  
- Data subjectivity → why we emphasize transparent, reproducible methods in this class  
- Census data → the foundation for most urban planning and policy analysis  
- R skills → the tools to do this work professionally and ethically  

## Reflection

- The data is clean and samples are sufficiently random and large to be representative.  
- Undocumented workers are likely to be excluded and those who are nomadic or without a permanent address.
