(2013) with microsimulation extensions.  \n\n- **Spatial Climate–Health Pipelines**  \n  - Dynamic extraction of precipitation/temperature anomalies via CHIRPS/NOAA rasters.  \n  - Integrating z-scores and climate windows aligned with DHS/MICS survey interviews.  \n\n---\n\n## Publications\n\n1. **Disparate social impacts by satellite and self-report: Floods in Pernambuco, Brazil** —
